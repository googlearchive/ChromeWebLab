## Introduction
This an example of a 'musical' instrument that can be developed using the Chrome Web Lab's Orchestra system. For a full description of the history and concept of the project, see [this page](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/ChromeWebLab/tree/master/Orchestra).

But we're here to make something. Specifically, this thing:

![Dremelphone](images/intro1.jpg)

A MIDI-controlled whirlophone. A MIDI-controlled servo/percussive tonal experience, powered by a hobby rotary power tool.

## Materials

The first step is to acquire all of the parts we will need to build this project. 

Tools:

* Safety goggles
* Band saw or handheld jigsaw
* Scissors
* Hot glue gun and a little bit of hot glue
* Wire cutter/stripper

Electronics:

## Electronics

1. Follow the images and wiring diagram.

## Building the Base

**Important**: Always wear safety goggles while using power tools. In fact, you should wear safety goggles while using this instrument.

1. Layout on Clock Face
We're going to lay out all the cutlines on the clock face first. First, draw two perpendicular diameters. Make a mark at 2" and 2 1/4" in from the circle's edge along each line. The 2" mark is where we're going to drill. 

2. Drill and Cut Slots

3. Cut Cam and other Parts

4. Predrill for Screws

5. Attach cams to servos

6. Align servos in slots and mark

7. Attach Hinges and Servos

8. Attach Base Legs

9. Connect wiring

10. Glue Glasses

11. Make Threaded Bead

12. Tune Glasses with water

13. Fire it up!
